modified Jonathan's code
to take in multiple files in local directory


python knowledge learned
1. os.path.join()
    this is useful when creating subdirectory
2. os.listdir()
    can be used to get all the filenames in the directory
    there are
3. os.getcwd()
    get current working directory


The input1.xml and input2.xml are created from input0.xml.
I just change the name in the caption.
