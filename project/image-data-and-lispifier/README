This directory is for Qiyuan's experimentation with image data etc.
==============================================================
The files with names of individuals or themes, such as "grandma-moshe"
or "graduation2", contain the data sets taken directly from the MKAM site,
http://71.197.235.138:8080/WebAnnotate/, selecting 
noahf/STTR Data/{a specific image}/results.

The data were obtained from the MKAM site Aug 6/12.

Each file contains
@ the name of the image = the filename with .jpg added to the end
@ one or more labels of form "Human" with an attached integer,
  where each such label is followed by
  - a table of (nonbinary) feature judgements by humans and the machine
  - a table of (binary) attribute judgements by humans and the machine
  - a table of weights assigned by the machine to each (nonbinary) feature value
  - a table of weights assigned by the machine to each (binary) attribute value

The original intention was to arrange image data and captions into
the form

   ((image-name1 caption1 (human_i certi attr1 cert1 ... attrk certk)
                          (human_j certj ...                     ...)
                          ... )
    (image-name2 caption2 (human_m certm ...                     ...)
                          (human_n certn ...                     ...)
                          ... )

But the caption data will be supplied separately (see ../image-captions/)
and at the time of writing it's unclear whether the exact data form
above will be constructed from the raw data and captions.

The file "reggi-ben-old-data" contains an example of image data in that 
form, but with numbers inferred from the phase1,option1 progress report.
