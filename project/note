I tested my test server
I found out that the python resides at
#!/usr/bin/env python
#!/usr/bin/python
--------------------------------------
The version of python is 2.7.3
This is found out by python -V

Can I use php and mySQL server to do the reasoning?


what do you want to do 
what is the challenge
why doing this

what is some terminology 
what are the tools you are using
how do you use this thing
show me your result

show me an example 

how do you evaluate your result?

--------------------------------------
For the lispify-image-date.lisp I changed the
lispify function "Image/~s" to "./~s". 

This function takes in the file in the
same directory it resides and turn it into 
lisp format.
